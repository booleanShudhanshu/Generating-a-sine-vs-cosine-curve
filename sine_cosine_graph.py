# For this project, you will have a generate a sine vs cosine curve.
# You will need to use the numpy library to access the sine and cosine functions.
# You will also need to use the matplotlib library to draw the curve.
# To make this more difficult, make the graph go from -360° to 360°,
# with there being a 180° difference between each point on the x-axis.

from matplotlib import pyplot
import numpy as np 

x=[-360,-180,0,180,360]
sine_y=[0,0,0,0,0,0]
cosine_y=[1,1,1,1,1]
